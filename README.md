# Ticketing-System

This was a three part class project for a ticketing system that can be used to organize large events. It organizes attendees and creates seating arrangements based on user customized inputs.
The three parts consisted of algorithm, UI, and graphic design.
For this project, my partner and I were in charge of the user interface component of the ticketing system.
To seamlessly integrate all the components together, we effectively followed a UML diagram for success.
